#Recipe Sharing App

###New concepts:  Partials in Rails.

As a contributor, I want to post new recipes, so that I can share them with others.

As a contributor, I want to tag my recipes, so that they are easier to find.

As a cook, I want to choose a tag and see what recipes have that tag.

As a cook, I want to give a recipe 1 through 5 stars, so that I can share with others what I think of a recipe.

As a cook, I want to see recipes ordered by the number of stars they have, so that I can focus on the best ones.
